# RamanSRS-Interpolation
Interpolated Raman Spectrums using wavenumbers from 2801-3056 non-linearly and are smoothed with a Gaussian Filter<br />

<br />
For the File called Interpolate_ML, you can change the directory of the input and output folder. The folders there were just ones I created for my purposes. 
<br />

<br />
Lastly, in the Interpolated_References folder, there is a Test.py file that allows you to see what the plot looks like of the original spectrum and the interpolated spectrum from the wavenumber ranges of 2081-3056 cm-1.
